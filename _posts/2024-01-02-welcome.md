Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to launch my personal blog today as part of my #100DaysOfCode journey (Day 14 - Round 2). This blog is built using GitHub Pages and features my own custom Jekyll theme: jekyll-minimal-synthwave.

## About the Theme

I wanted to create something minimalist yet stylish, and that's how jekyll-minimal-synthwave was born. The theme comes with some cool features:

- âœ¨ Clean, minimalist design
- ðŸŒ“ Dark/Light mode support
- ðŸŽ¨ Two distinct styles:
  - Synthwave: For that retro-futuristic vibe
  - Hacker: For a classic terminal look

## Tech Stack

This blog is built with:
- Jekyll
- GitHub Pages
- Custom SCSS
- Lots of â˜• and ðŸ’»

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing my coding journey, technical tutorials, and thoughts about software development. Expect posts about:
- Web Development
- Open Source
- Programming tips and tricks
- My #100DaysOfCode progress

Feel free to switch between the synthwave and hacker themes by checking out the different styles in the configuration!

Stay tuned for more content, and don't forget to check out the theme repository if you want to use it in your own blog.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
